| 1–2     | Position in \[RB, WR], ignore rookie/handcuff/lottery unless top-ranked            |
| 3–5     | Position in \[RB, WR], consider elite QB/TE if top-ranked, rookie/lottery optional |
| 6–8     | Include rookies, handcuffs, lottery tickets along with remaining top WR/RB         |
| 9+      | Focus mostly on rookies, lottery tickets, and handcuffs for bench spots            |
| Final 2 | Filter for K or D/ST only                                                          |

| Rounds 3–5     | Continue top WR/RB, but grab QB/TE if they’re elite and underpicked            |
| Rounds 6–8     | Mix of top WR/RB + consider high-upside rookies, lottery tickets, or handcuffs |
| Rounds 9+      | Focus on upside players (lottery tickets, rookies, handcuffs), fill bench      |

Here's what I'm going to do.
1. Query Sleeper API for all players data.
2. Go to FantasyPros. Download the main player rankings list. 
3. Identify players that are Rookie's Handcuffs and Lottery tickets
4. Implement some kind of strategy helper for draft day.
